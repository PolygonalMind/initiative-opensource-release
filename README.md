One of the first projects developed during 2023 is a collaboration with MoCA. After deciding on a vaporwave aesthetic, we released a set of 5 rooms that can be used as galleries by their owners. These rooms have now been taken apart, allowing anyone to separately work on any asset and arrange their own dioramas.
<br>
 This package is for you if you're in need of 80s typical assets such as tube tvs, old Windows icons, or retro furniture equipment.
